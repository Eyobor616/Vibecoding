# Build a Full-Stack Todo App with Google AI Studio + Supabase  
**A Complete Beginner-to-Deploy Learning Resource**  
(Everything you need in one place – updated November 2025)

You just followed a real conversation that took someone from zero to a deployed, database-backed Todo app using only AI prompts. Here’s the entire journey turned into a polished, reusable guide + the best learning resources on the internet.

### Project Overview
Goal: Build a beautiful Todo List web app that saves data permanently using:
- Google AI Studio (Gemini) → generates all code with natural language
- React + Vite + Tailwind (frontend)
- Supabase (free PostgreSQL + auth + storage)
- Vercel (free 1-click deploy)

Time to complete: 30–60 minutes for your first working app

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Start in Google AI Studio
Link: https://aistudio.google.com  
→ Click “Build” → New project

**Prompt 1 – Generate the full app**
```text
Create a full-stack Todo List web app called "My AI Todo".

Tech stack:
- React + Vite frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase as the database (PostgreSQL)
- Use Supabase JavaScript client

Features:
• List all todos
• Add new todo
• Toggle complete with checkbox
• Delete todo
• Data persists in Supabase (table: todos)
• Modern card UI, light/dark mode toggle, mobile-friendly
• Show "Connected" indicator when loaded

First create the Supabase table schema, then generate complete working code.
```

#### 2. Create Your Free Supabase Project
Link: https://supabase.com/dashboard  
1. New Project → wait ~2 minutes  
2. Run this SQL (SQL Editor → New query):
```sql
create table todos (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  task text not null,
  is_complete boolean default false,
  inserted_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);
```

#### 3. Get Your Supabase URL & Anon Key
Dashboard → Settings → API  
You’ll need:
- Project URL → `SUPABASE_URL`
- anon public key → `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

#### 4. Connect the App to Your Real Database
Back in AI Studio chat, paste:
```text
Replace mock data with real Supabase connection.
Use these exact values:
SUPABASE_URL = "https://xyz.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "eyJhbGciOi..."

Implement full CRUD with proper loading states and error handling.
```

#### 5. Allow Full CRUD (No Restrictions – Great for Prototyping)
Two options (choose one):

**Option A – Disable RLS (default & fastest)**
Just make sure RLS is OFF on the todos table → full access automatically.

**Option B – Enable RLS + permissive policies**
Run this SQL:
```sql
alter table todos enable row level security;

create policy "anon read"  on todos for select  using (auth.role() = 'anon');
create policy "anon insert" on todos for insert  with check (auth.role() = 'anon');
create policy "anon update" on todos for update using (true) with check (auth.role() = 'anon');
create policy "anon delete" on todos for delete using (auth.role() = 'anon');
```

#### 6. Polish the Design (Optional but Fun)
Prompt examples:
```text
Add confetti when completing a task (use canvas-confetti)
Floating + button, gradient background, empty state illustration
Skeleton loaders while fetching
```

#### 7. Deploy in 1 Click
In AI Studio → Click “Deploy” → Choose Vercel → Done!  
You get a live URL instantly.
